# China Theme ETFs

There are a bunch of China theme ETFS, 'ASHR', 'FXI', 'KBA', 'GLCN', 'MCHI', 'CNYA', to name a few. How to pick and choose from these ETFs when you decide to invest in a broad China concept?

We'd better to dive into their components. 

In terms of number of holdings, I draw the comparison as below and can say that MSCI is more comprehensive a basket, while FXI only includes a dense list of large caps. 
- MCHI    609
- KBA     475
- CNYA    475
- ASHR    301
- GLCN    198
- FXI      52

Even MCHI is more broad the portfolio is not even, the top 10 holding contribute over 50% weighting, they are
- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Sponsored ADR20.29%
- Tencent Holdings Ltd.14.19%
- Meituan Dianping Class B4.16%
- JD.com, Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A2.43%
- China Construction Bank Corporation Class H2.32%
- Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. Class H2.30%
- China Mobile Limited1.48%
- NetEase, Inc. Sponsored ADR1.37%
- Baidu, Inc. Sponsored ADR Class A1.27%
- Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited Class H1.18%

While KBA even it also contains a large list, it is more China (meaning stocks are listed in A shares, while MCHI's are primarily in Hong Kong exchange), the top 10 contributes only 20%
- Kweichow Moutai Co., Ltd. Class A5.90%
- Wuliangye Yibin Co., Ltd. Class A2.41%
- Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. Class A2.32%
- China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd. Class A2.09%
- Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. Class A1.37%
- Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd. Class A1.34%
- Foshan Haitian Flavouring & Food Co., Ltd. Class A1.23%
- China Tourism Group Duty Free Corporation Limited Class A1.22%
- China Yangtze Power Co., Ltd. Class A1.18%
- Luxshare Precision Industry Co. Ltd. Class A1.12%

Worthnoting, KBA has 87% overlapping with MCHI.

Before investing real money into this kind of ETFs, you would naturally also raise a question, China’s economy has been booming in the last 40 years like a miracle, but Why Didn’t the Chinese Stock Market Go Up Like the GDP?
See below the GDP growth chart:![](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-real-gdp-per-capita-across-countries-and-regions)

Even US’s GDP is leading far ahead but the acceleration rate is clearly smaller than China and in no time, China’s GDP will surpass the United States’.

Along the way, Chinese people’s income also grow rapidly. However, what’s interesting to observe is that the Real Estate market and stock market are growing in very dis-proportionally pace with clear bubble in over heated RE market, while stock market relatively flat in last 40 some years. Why so?

There are multiple version of answers on Quora, but I think it has to be viewed and interpreted from the uniqueness of China, which essentially is not a true capitalism but one party enforcing a capitalism like game.

I filtered out the top 10 companies listed in Shenzhen (SHE), Shanghai(SHG) and Hongkong(HKG) markets.

Shengzhen market is sort of like Nasdaq, with more Consumer, Technology, Industrials in the bucket. The highest is alcohol producer Wuliangye with the market value at below $200B size.
