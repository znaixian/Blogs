There are a bunch of China theme ETFS, 'ASHR', 'FXI', 'KBA', 'GLCN', 'MCHI', 'CNYA', to name a few. How to pick and choose from these ETFs when you decide to invest in a broad China concept?

We'd better to dive into their components. 

In terms of number of holdings, I draw the comparison as below and can say that MSCI is more comprehensive a basket, while FXI only includes a dense list of large caps. 
- MCHI    609
- KBA     475
- CNYA    475
- ASHR    301
- GLCN    198
