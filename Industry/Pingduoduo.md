## Industry Arena of PDD - Internet Department Store

What’s unique about this company is that the founder has following Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos, issuing a letter to the shareholders each year. This is the second/2020 letter:

What time?

In February, the world learned a new word, “COVID-19”, which upended our lives. As I write this, half of the world remains confined at home, waiting for the tiny virus that causes COVID-19 to leave us. During the early days of the outbreak, as we waited in solidarity, we eagerly hoped to return to normal. But as the world has been put on hold week after week, we start to forget time.

We cannot help but ask ourselves, what is the time we are in now and what is time?

We are in a time of crisis – of division, misinformation, and chaos. The virus has caused countless conflicts and contrasts as we watch the news around us and worldwide. It is an unprecedented time to most of us. Yet if we put it in the context of the human history, it might just be a normal incident, a drop in the ocean.

This virus is a messenger by Mother Nature. Out of self-protection and preservation, our bodies desperately fought it using all the strength and energy available. Soon enough, the war against this seemingly unstoppable virus extended from our own bodies to the broader organisms that make up our society (if we see every institution as a living organism made up of people and relationships with a mission and purpose). Companies, governments, countries, big and small, are all scrambling in their own ways to combat this life-threatening virus. In these attempts, we possibly have unintentionally introduced more damage to ourselves.

These all started with an almost invisible virus, a tiny messenger carrying some information (RNA) and a negligible amount of energy that, independent of a host, cannot even replicate. It is in stark contrast with nuclear threat, the power we feared for decades. Which is more capable of greater and more prolonged damage to our human society then – a mushroom cloud representing massive destructive energy, or a “messenger” with virtually no energy?

We cannot help but wonder if this is a lesson purposefully delivered, a punishment, a redemption, or simple irony? No matter what it is, it is surreal to me.

Time for new

When Einstein wrote down his famous E = MC2, he elegantly (in some sense also arrogantly) depicted a physical world in his mind. However, what he did not explain in his theory of relativity is the relationship between the human mind and the physical world, nor the relationship between energy and information.

Today, in this bizarre time, millions of people are staying at home, physically cut off from their families and friends. Yet we are connected and unified in spirit through shared sentiment, which in turn affects the physical world. The boundaries between the virtual and physical worlds are unprecedentedly blurred, and we are beginning to see (not just envision) a new world. In this new world, the phrase “virtual reality” is obsolete. Reality has become virtual and virtual has become part of reality. Similarly, the distinction between humanity’s physical needs and spiritual needs is also becoming vague.

When this tiny virus was dropped into our world, it acted just like a catalyst in a test tube, accelerating the formation of a whole new world. Inevitably, some dimensions of the previous world are being restructured, some rules are being rewritten. The impact of this sweeping force will fundamentally and permanently change the world we are in now. Just like what I explained in the previous shareholder letters about PDD’s formation, new models are bound to emerge and grow in a whole new setup. We are indeed seeing the phasing out of some as new ones emerge. It is the time of reestablishment.

Human beings have long used reason to try to understand and control the world. In many cases, we succeeded, for example, science. In science, we strive to detach ourselves from the physical world we are in, to watch it as if we are a higher being “objectively” observing, understanding, and defining the world into a finite number of equations. In this framework, time is a reversible parameter in the equation -t = (-)t. It is merely a parameter in an equation to describe a predetermined trajectory of an object.

However, when an almost invisible virus awoken us to the reality that we are not above the world, but just a negligible part of the world to be observed, the only thing we can do is to sit still and let time carry its course. We then realize time is not really a parameter in an equation, but an irreversible vector. It is a silent and relentless directional force driving everything we see and feel. It effortlessly creates asymmetry, irreversibility and mortality, no matter how stubbornly and desperately we yearn for symmetry and immortality.

While the first law of thermodynamics (∆U = Q-W) gives us a sense of control and certainty, the second law (∆S ≥ 0) humbles us to acknowledge the unknown beyond just force and mass we used to define our physical world. Entropy (S) also relates to information. I am not sure if entropy relates to the spiritual world, but it does help us feel and comprehend time. Again, it is not a reversible parameter, but a silent and irreversible driving force beyond and behind both the physical and the spiritual world.2.Time, crowd and uncertainty

When Newton revealed F = M(dV/dT), it gave us a delusive sense of control, or at least it allowed our wishful thinking that we can finally harness force. We no longer have to worry, because every object has a calculable trajectory determined by its position, mass, velocity and force. We assume each object’s current state fully encompasses and explains its past and that each object is independent. With that, large number of interactions among large number of objects over time would increase complexity and appear chaotic and uncertain, hence probabilistic. It seems that time has created this chaos and uncertainty. And probability is just a statistical aggregation of the trajectories of a large number of objects.

However, when we are isolated at home, waiting with anxiety and unsettling emotions, we start to doubt whether the notion of each object being independent is really a valid assumption in our attempt to understand and explain the world. In our yearning for certainty, we have conveniently chosen to accept some assumptions, such as independence among each object, that can help us explain the world. Our desire for certainty is so strong that we start believing it is truth.

But what if probability is a fundamental feature of each object, rather than a result of statistical aggregation? What if the large number of objects is intrinsically intertwined and interrelated? Just like our human society, no matter how independent each individual is, we are intrinsically connected both physically and spiritually. And these connections define who we are and our existence.

Because of these connections, the divide-and-conquer approach is no longer effective to reduce uncertainty. Instead, we see the large number of interactions among individuals over time becoming a force that brings order and certainty to the society. Again, we feel the force and magic of time.

Seize the time

When COVID-19 swept the earth, every organism was confronted with the brutal reality of Mother Nature. Some of us who are relatively young cannot help but to feel grateful and lucky. This is not to say that we see an opportunity to take advantage of during the crisis. In fact, I despise the saying “don’t waste a crisis”. A crisis is a crisis. Nobody can come out as a winner in the midst of a catastrophe. Any wishful thinking to capture the “opportunities” (or exploiting loopholes) to benefit oneself seems foolish in the face of time. It is akin to a presumptuous gambler trying to outsmart time at a casino.

Instead, we feel the urge to work even harder. Because we, more than ever, understand and appreciate how precious youth is. More than ever, we realize that we now have our duty to fulfil. We need to demonstrate that our generation is innovative and different, that in this new world, new species and new creatures are bound to emerge and grow. Mother Nature will flourish and progress, regardless of any individual’s will. Understanding these rules of nature does not make us feel superior, nor does it give us the power to rule and order. On the contrary, it humbles us to admit that we are just part of a natural evolution of the world. One poet captured it all: “As I silently look back, all the sorrows and joy, all the twists and turns, of life, vanished like sands in the desert. And now I know, all I have accomplished, is just a part of life.”

With this perspective and in this new world, we feel humble and calm. We are tremendously grateful for our precious youth, and we feel the weight of our duty. As a result, we will be more than ever committed to investing in the future, and to be part of the driving force to the new world we are seeing. The journey has only started.

This is our Carpe Diem. This is our C’est La Vie.

Below is the first letter he wrote in 2019(2018 fiscal year):

Pinduoduo is not a conventional company. We founded Pinduoduo when the China market accepted the status quo of the existing e-commerce landscape and thought its formative phase had come to an end. Within three years, Pinduoduo has attracted over 300 million active buyers and over 1 million merchants through a new shopping format and experience. This exponential growth shows unlimited potential of our platform. As our three-year-old platform is still burgeoning, we know we face many obvious challenges and uncertainties ahead. Hence, why are we bringing Pinduoduo into the ebbs and flows of the capital markets so soon? We’d appreciate you hearing our thoughts in this letter.

●    We think the e-commerce business is closely tied with social impacts and responsibilities, and therefore its growth and value should be shared with the public;

●    We believe in the tremendous potential of our platform; therefore, if we take a long-term view, there is no difference for our listing in three years, five years or longer. On the contrary, with public scrutiny and regulatory supervision, we may grow better and stronger; and

●    We envision Pinduoduo to be an organization that reports to the public. It should create value for the public, rather than being a show-off trophy for a few or carrying too much personal color. We want it to be an independent organization that brings value to the society with its unique organizational structure and corporate culture. Most importantly, it should continue to strive to better itself.

Now as the founder, I would like to give you more color on my observation and vision for Pinduoduo so as to give you a more concrete understanding of the company you are investing into.

What does Pinduoduo do?

●    Pinduoduo dedicates itself to creating a commingled “space” between cyberspace and physical space, where users can find the most value-for-money merchandise that meet their different needs and derive happiness;

●    Pinduoduo leverages a platform and an ecosystem comprised of hundreds of millions of users, merchants, platform management personnel/operators and platform infrastructure/service providers; while each player is interdependent with one another, all of them evolve and improve as they constantly try to balance cost-effectiveness, efficiency, user experience and satisfaction;

●    Pinduoduo’s survival depends on the value it creates for its users; I hope our team wakes up feeling anxious every day, never because of share price volatilities, but because of their constant fear of users departing if we are unable to anticipate and meet users’ changing needs; and

●    Pinduoduo is dedicated to investing in the future and will always focus on the long term. It might appear too aggressive or too conservative at times. However, it always follows the basic and simple principle—growing its long term intrinsic value.

Company Value

Pinduoduo’s core value is “本分” (Ben Fen). It is difficult to express it perfectly in English, but it essentially means to adhere firmly to one’s own duties and principles. There are several layers of meaning here:

●    Be honest and trustworthy;

●    Discharge our own duties and responsibilities regardless of others’ conduct;

●    Insulate our minds from outside pressures so that we can focus on the very simple basics of what we should be doing;

●    Never take advantage of others even when we are in a position to do so;

●    Self-reflect and take responsibilities when problems arise instead of blaming others.

Specifically for Pinduoduo, the management’s 本分 (Ben Fen) is to relentlessly focus on value creation for our consumers. We may not always be understood, but we always do things out of goodwill and do no evil.

Going forward

In the past three years, Pinduoduo has established and promoted a new e-commerce concept and experience of “team purchase” (or “拼”, “pin”). We can reasonably expect that it would evolve into a variety of “pin” formats. We also hope that other innovative formats for different user scenarios will be created just like how we have created “pin” today.

If you close your eyes and visualize the next stage for Pinduoduo, it would be an exemplification of a multi-dimensional space, seamlessly integrating cyberspace and the physical space. It would be a combination of “Costco” and “Disneyland” (value-for-money and entertainment combined), driven by a distributed network of intelligence agents (versus the popular super-brain-like centralized AI system). It not only matches information efficiently, but also constantly puts the social interactions of the universe into consideration to make the entire experience more enjoyable.

As part of the process to constantly meet users’ needs, we are highly aligned to be the driving force to improve the efficiency and quality of the supply chain. One good example would be the agricultural industry. China has relatively less arable land per capita given its population and landscape. This is different from countries like the United States, where large-scale farms are prevalent, and the production and transportation of agricultural products could be highly industrialized. We find “pin” an effective solution to aggregate consumer demand, match them with batches of agricultural produce, and mobilize China’s well-penetrated and affordable logistics capability to have perishable and fresh produce shipped directly from farms to users and bypass multiple layers of distribution. This not only enhances user experience, but more importantly, helps to turn small scale agriculture production of different quality, variety, and volume into a semi-customized batch processing mechanism. It lowers the unnecessary costs of agricultural consumption and potentially makes small scale customized services viable. The social impact and value to our society would far exceed our business success or the perceived valuation of the company. We are excited by the small impact we see today, and think this would be a trend even beyond agriculture.

Appreciation for our investors

We are grateful to those who are willing to invest in Pinduoduo after reading through the utopian ideas above. It is not easy to take the leap of faith believing in such an unconventional company, which strives to meet both economic and social needs of users, and to make a positive impact to the society. The pursuit and focus of our long-term vision and intrinsic value may not always translate into near-term profits. Instead, we hope to show you the true colors of our company no matter how bumpy or rough the numbers may seem to be. We ask you to ride the journey with us for the long term. We believe it will be wonderful.

So, what should you expect from Pinduoduo as an investor?

First of all, you can reasonably believe that we are far from the best we could achieve. In fact, we are probably at our most rudimentary level of services now if we look forward in 10 years’ time. Yet, many of our users have chosen to believe in us. We are encouraged and have every reason to believe that as we work hard day after day to improve our services, more and more users will stick with us, believe in us.

Secondly, you should expect a team with passion that is trustworthy and always focuses on serving users and our company’s intrinsic value. We have the courage and the ability to invest in long-term opportunities.

Pinduoduo, as a growing organization, will always dedicate itself to do the right things, to create value for our society, and to make this world a better and happier place.


The very first step in looking into this company is to understand where it is competing. To put things into perspective, it is playing head-on with the strongest players such as Amazon and Alibaba. 
![internet department store](https://github.com/znaixian/Blogs/blob/master/Industry/media/department%20store%20general%20merchandise%20retail.png)

Even traditional merchants still take up about $1 trillion market value, online stores are catching up rapidly to nowadays taking 40% of traditional's - $398 billion. Absurdly, Amazon's total revenue last year is only $195 billion, but its total market value is pushed up to $1.48 trillion now. Alibaba likewise attains $731 billion, half of Amazon's with  only a quarter of its revenue - $55 billion. Relatively, PDD is valued higher than Alibaba with $4.3 billion revenue, it should be valued at $57 billion, however, current value of PDD stays high at $96 billion. Moving on to November 17th, 2020, just a few months later, the price of PDD-US has skyrocked to have reached $150, hence the market cap. has been up to $170 billion.

It's becasue of the recent earnings annoucement exceeded expectation. According to the Wechat source ( 德林社), “双11”之后的第1天，11月12日，拼多多公布了2020年的三季报。各项核心数据大超预期，特别是年度活跃买家数已经达到7.31亿，直逼阿里，特别值得一提的是，在非美国通用会计准则下拼多多首次季度实现盈利4.66亿元。

市值增长的背后，是资本认可拼多多的商业模式及其产生的商业价值。外界看到，拼多多满足用户极致性价比需求的用户认知心智正在形成。

去年同期拼多多公布三季报数据时，外界对其彼时5.363亿的年活跃买家用户数大为惊呼，在这个指标上，仅在2015年成立的拼多多已经完成了对京东的超越，只位居阿里巴巴之下。

事实证明，快速增长的拼多多还在快速增长。今年的三季报数据显示，过去一年的时间，拼多多上年度活跃买家数增长了1.95亿，已经来到了7.31亿，实打实的一半中国人都在“拼”的拼多多. To sum, the active users keep increasing at a high rate of almost 50%, soon it could surpass Alibaba. Not only does the number of users increase, but also the average consumption per user. 
![](.research/../../pictures/pinduoduo%20user%20increase.png)

在衡量商业价值的重要维度指标交易额（GMV）上， 截至今年9月底的前12个月平台GMV达14576亿元，同比增长73%。这一增速是行业平均水平的8倍。拼多多平台的日物流订单峰值已经突破1亿单.

近期，高盛援引数据机构Quest Mobile的报告称，第三季度拼多多APP的用户总时长达到5310亿分钟，较去年同比增长101%。在第三季度，拼多多用户使用时长已经占据中国所有电商服务平台用户总时长的41%，较二季度的34%大幅提升7个百分点。一切的数据表明，用户做出了选择，一半的国人都在拼多多上“拼”。用户的选择自然就会驱动资本的选择。

验证了拼多多商业模式和战略打法；面向未来看，拼多多的用户规模跃居中国电商第一成为大概率事件，同时，拼多多传统强项农产品产业正在成为电商争夺的一个10万亿级赛道，有望成为拼多多增长的新驱动.

在拼多多的三季报中，有一个数据格外特别，那就是补贴和推广费用，这一数据达到100.7亿元，同比增长了46%。在拼多多的三季报中，有一个数据格外特别，那就是补贴和推广费用，这一数据达到100.7亿元，同比增长了46%。“敢”代表的是意愿，“能”背后则是洞察商业本质后，确保战略的执行落地和可持续。

从愿景看，拼多多要服务的对象是消费者，目的是让消费者有物超所值的产品。这就回归到消费者的本质需求上来，其核心是产品的价格、质量和服务。也就是极致的性价比。痛点有了，拼多多就通过持续“百亿补贴”这样的类似于“天天双11”的活动，将消费者喜欢的产品价格降下来。再通过创设“假一赔十”的消费者赔付金制度，确保产品质量和服务。让平台上产品的极具性价比。

拼多多的意图很明显，那就是让外界提起谁是满足中国最广大人群性价比需求的新电商平台时，首先想到的是拼多多。

核心就在于其对商业本质的洞察，即平台只有“利他”才能实现自己的价值。而电商平台上两个核心主体就是用户侧和产品供给侧（商家），如何高效率地服务用户侧和供给侧进而实现“利他”是拼多多要解决的问题。

围绕这个核心问题，拼多多在前端通过社交拼团和算法模式的创新，系统性降低了流量获取成本，在后端，则通过供应链改革、产地直发等模式，创造围绕以性价比为核心的商品供给。而在市场活动上，拼多多持续通过百亿补贴活动为消费者提供最需要的商品。

也就是说，供给侧端的商家通过拼多多的赋能，降低了传统电商模式下的生产、销售成本，进而可以提供更具性价比的产品。而消费者端在享受更具性价比产品时，叠加拼多多的百亿补贴，能够获得更好的消费体验。

当拼多多平台品牌力与市场地位持续提升，又会带来商家更高广告需求，驱动货币化率提升。比如拼多多三季度实现营业收入 142.10 亿元，同比增长89.1%，单季度货币化率为 3.2%，同比增长了0.2个百分点。

用户规模、GMV、货币化率三个维度指标的健康增长，又会驱动拼多多财务更加良性。截至三季度末，拼多多的现金、现金等价物及短期投资合计达到456亿元。

强劲的现金流和盈利的趋势又可以反哺“百亿补贴”的力度和可持续性，并且对“多多买菜”等一系列新增业务提供支持。这个闭环形成拼多多极深的护城河。

中国的顶尖产品人梁宁在一次公开演讲中说，自己在淘宝上搜“无锡排骨”，淘宝的关联推荐还是“无锡排骨”“三凤桥”这一类关键词的匹配。

但在拼多多上搜“无锡排骨”，拼多多除了关联“无锡排骨”“三凤桥”，还会给她推荐“四喜丸子”。

梁宁认为，这说明淘宝的算法是在做关键词关联，而拼多多在做用户理解，它试图理解用户的搜索动机和偏好。

创始人黄峥便在致股东的第一封公开信中做出过解释：

你可以想象它（拼多多）是一个将网络虚拟空间和现实世界紧密融合在一起的多维空间。

它将是一个由分布式智能代理网络（而非时下流行的集中式超级大脑型AI系统）驱动的“Costco”和“迪士尼”（即集高性价比产品和娱乐为一体）的结合体。

它不光高效地做信息的匹配，还不停地模拟着整个空间里人群的群体情绪，并试图对整个空间做调整，让群体的体验更加开心。

这套“人为先”模式的技术基石，其创建者正是当时的拼多多CTO陈磊。

从谷歌、雅虎、IBM任职，再到2007年和黄峥创业做B2C电商和淘宝代运营公司，陈磊曾总结，全球互联网巨头尤其是传统电商平台的发展从技术角度来说，“万法归一”。

他将之归纳为“Scuba模型”：即场景（Scene）驱动服务，服务带来用户（User），用户带来数据（Big Data），数据经由A.I和Computing（计算能力）处理后，优化用户体验，体验又带来新用户增长，形成正向循环。

这正是传统互联网公司所遵循的典型模式。在这套模式下，巨头们不约而同地想要建造一个无所不能的上帝式中央大脑。

在加入拼多多之初，陈磊便判断，这一“中央大脑”模式并不可持续。

首先，由于公开数据和隐私数据边界模糊。政府的监管政策随之收紧，互联网获取用户信息的渠道被迫收窄，中央大脑将会面临数据饥渴，传统电商也将陷入流量瓶颈。

其次，集权式AI的机器学习还存在“偏好囚笼”，基于消费者片刻的购物冲动之上的预测，往往将其限制在乏味的单一喜好之中，消费者会变得愈发挑剔，越试图通过关键词猜你喜欢，却越猜越不准。

如果有一种技术架构能够将购买同一类商品的用户需求之间的差异性体现出来，是否更像是在模拟用户之间的需求互动？

陈磊主导建设的分布式人工智能体系，核心目标是在社交互动的推荐基础上，通过分布式算法理解每个消费者的个体差异，将所有算法、数据、AI都独立呈现给每个用户，让每个用户都有自己的算法体系，模拟和增强用户之间的互动。

他坚信，分布式人工智能将成为下一个十年的“水电煤”，成为互联网的底层公共服务平台，整体的逻辑循环也将发生巨大变革，“每个人可以随意调取自己的云计算代理，每个月都能收到云计算账单，就像收水电煤的账单一样。”

将战略定位分解为框架性的技术问题，再通过场景落地不断接近战略目标，这正是陈磊过去作为CTO的典型思路。

在掌管拼多多后，这套思路和打法也同样被植入了拼多多的日常业务之中。

一个细节是，拼多多直到这一季财报才扭亏为盈，但从未停止对技术研发的投入，研发费用持续上升，2018年同比增长超过7倍，2019年超过6倍。今年第三季度，拼多多研发投入18亿元，同比增长了60%。

2020年之前，拼多多解决了“找到用户”的问题，但在陈磊接管时，拼多多需要解决的问题变得更复杂：在找到和聚集用户之后，还要找到模式落地的最佳场景以满足用户的深层需求。

农业，正是陈磊找到的答案。

各大电商平台疯抢的主播是罗永浩、薇娅、李佳琦、辛巴、刘涛等等明星网红主播，各大平台也将珍贵的流量资源纷纷灌入这些带有话题效应的明星人物直播间。同样的流量和同样的资金，拼多多却全部投入了农产品直播。一位国产美妆品牌的电商负责人笑称，“一开始的确弄不明白拼多多想干什么，同样是百万级的流量，多卖点儿面膜肯定比卖大米的性价比高多了，打开直播间就是玉米大豆，也很难有话题效应”。


农产品上行是拼多多起家的关键，而在陈磊出任CEO后，农产品的战略地位得到进一步提升。“变得更重、更深”，一位内部人士表示，陈磊多次对内强调，拼多多做农业要到地里去，“在陈磊的带领下，做农业的员工都要重新跟着农产品走完从生产到消费的全过程，形成观察报告后一起讨论，还有哪些环节是拼多多可以优化的，形成结论后，立刻立项上线”。

多位农业相关员工证实，陈磊本人在接任CEO后也长期在各大农产区调研，在陈磊的带动下，几个月下来，农产品部门的人都黑了三层，“下乡出个差回来，大家都不太认识了”。

拼多多在农业领域的布局正在越来越重，先后进入了农产品的研发、生产、运输和终端配送的全领域。而在农产品的物流运输环节，陈磊主导建设完成了拼多多的全新农产品物流体系。

陈磊从拼多多的技术团队中抽调了近百名骨干集中研发，该系统目前已经上线运转。公开报道显示，这套系统在前端基于平台的物流信息、农产品订单信息和农产区信息等数据，对农产品的快递物流体系进行了重新梳理调配，在后端，则在各农产区和各大物流快递企业合作，共同开设农产品专列。

过去，农产品快递包裹“苹果和拖鞋混在一起”，因此，城市用户购买农产品后往往收到的水果“坏果率”难以保证，而据拼多多团队调研发现，主要原因是“送货下乡的大货车，往往是半空着就回城了”。

因此，为优化用户体验，拼多多的全新农产品物流体系能做到让快递物流“送手机下乡，运苹果回城”，实现农产品专列运输，大幅提升物流效率和消费者体验。

多多买菜，正是被视为是“覆盖更多农产品消费场景”的战略组成部分。在刚结束的财报电话会上，陈磊向投资者解释，多多买菜是拼多多基于农产品上行的主营业务的自然延伸，此前积累的技术、库存和种类丰富的农产品，可以满足消费者在生鲜领域的巨大需求。

而为了覆盖用户“次日自提”的农产品消费场景，陈磊还主导了对区域冷链、仓储、城市配送等基础设施进行大规模投资，为未来的农产品上行建设一套全新的分发节点。

从履历看，陈磊就读于清华大学、美国威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校，毕业后在雅虎和谷歌任职，均没有农业背景，但陈磊却成为了在农产品领域重注最多的互联网CEO，背后原因何在？

据拼多多内部人士介绍，一方面，陈磊在拼好货时期便是技术负责人，在当时看到了拼好货的巨大能量后，便对互联网模式改变农产品上行产生了兴趣，另一方面，陈磊在内部曾解释过，技术本身不重要，重要的是技术能够落地去改变什么，而中国相对传统的农业领域，恰好到了迫切需要技术寻求改变的关键时刻。

农产品消费是典型的刚需高频产品，也是传统电商忽略的市场，拼农产品本身的供应体系相对落后，拼多多拥有先发优势，如果用货找人的模式和技术去倒逼农产品行业变革，要比其他领域更彻底。

从公开报道来看，包括云南人参果、广西百香果、四川会理石榴等一系列区域特产农产品，都是通过拼多多而成为了“全国知名水果”，这背后，正是拼多多模式在应用。

陈磊接任CEO后，在内部率先调整了运营思路和流量分配规则。在运营思路上，从过去的“招商”改变为“招商+试验新品牌”，要求拼多多小二必须介入平台商家的制造底层，帮助商家梳理和讲解拼多多模式，成为“消费者需求数据和工厂生产线的对接管道”。

而在流量上，则进一步贯穿“人为先”模式，不断调整完善算法，让算法成为流量分配的核心，换句话说，要彻底实现每个用户打开拼多多之后，看到的都是自己的“算法代理人”量身定制的商品页面。

拼多多把品牌竞争从营销费用的互相倾轧，给拉到了谁能身段更低的服务用户上来”，上述拼多多人士表示。

种种迹象显示，在陈磊主导建设的分布式算法里，拼多多的新电商模式意味着最大程度的“以需定产”，决定商品销量和品牌认知的不再是竞价排名和营销，而是算法，而拼多多的算法，则最大程度上扮演了“消费者代理人”的角色。

一个对外公开报道的案例是金辉刀剪。金辉刀剪是双立人、WMF等世界顶级厨具品牌的代工期企业，疫情后，金辉刀剪将重心转向国内市场。

在拼多多支持下，基于国内消费者需求，金辉刀剪研发了一款“王麻子”砍切两用菜刀，用国际大牌的材质，功能更多，且价格只有前者的四分之一。

这把刀帮助金辉刀剪劈开了内销市场，也刷新了消费者对“王麻子”的认知。目前，仅拼多多上的“王麻子”相关刀剪销售额就近5000万元。

“和传统电商是完全不同的两套算法，在集中式算法下，一款新的产品要投入市场，需要大量烧钱开车（购买直通车），提高搜索排名。

但经过我们测算，在拼多多体系，一款新产品只要能够捕捉到用户需求，可能一夜就爆了，还没来得及投钱营销就已经卖光了”。

据透露，该企业今年在拼多多上线的一个新品牌，从6月上线后至今，已经迅速做到了数亿元的量级，“这款产品如果放在过去，是不可能有这样的价格，也不可能有这样的打法，没有任何广告宣传直接就爆了”。

新电商模式模拟消费者的决策过程，正是拼多多在技术底层上的追求。陈磊对内对此曾解释表示，分布式AI的模型可以基于相近的既有品牌购买行为进行模拟，针对用户和用户之间的互动捕捉个性化的需求，再进行算法上的优化，拼多多根据算法来决定商品的“陈列”，就能让更多贴近消费者真实需求的商品迅速规模化赢得市场。

行业内经常举的例子是，一根口红的成本价不会超过10块钱，但行业内比拼的，是谁能率先卖到100块。而为了能够卖到100块，品牌商需要花费不菲的营销成本，在传统电商平台参与双11等营销活动，购买竞价排名等等。

但在和拼多多合作后，上述受访者发现，拼多多的逻辑完全是相反的：算法发掘用户需求——平台收集用户愿意为同等商品支付的价格——品牌研发——平台上架销售。

而这套模式的基础，按照黄峥此前在公号的表述，是“把资本主义倒过来”。

2018年拼多多开始的新品牌计划，被视为是这一模式的“先锋队”。据内部人士透露，陈磊在9月提出，“要升级新品牌计划，充分展现拼多多模式的特征”。

今年10月，“新品牌计划”宣布升级，将进入100个产业带扶持当地的优秀制造企业。11月，这场战役率先在广州打响。拼多多宣布，未来两年拼多多将扎根中国化妆品产业带，培育50个亿级化妆品新品牌。

而在国产美妆行业中，选择加入拼多多的知名品牌越来越多，“我们知道的几乎所有国产一线品牌都已经和拼多多开始了合作”，上市美妆行业人士称。

一位券商分析师表示，“你可以把拼多多看作是一套中国互联网出现的全新算法，一家通过技术来了解用户、代表用户、满足用户的科技企业，陈磊的独特价值就是，没有人比他更了解这套体系从何处来、往何处去，只有算法规则的设计者，才知道在哪里才能最大程度发挥这套体系的价值”。

上述拼多多内部人士也认可了这一观点。他表示，在陈磊接任CEO后，“公司最大的变化是，更彻底地将新模式贯穿进公司的每一根毛细血管，并锲而不舍地捕捉应用新电商模式的最佳时机和最佳场景”。
