Citing the blog I wrote two years ago about Cryptocurrency Trading and Exchanges stocks: "There are a handful of publicly traded companies claiming to be cryptocurrency companies, taking advantage of investors' craze for this surging theme in the marketplace. They are the following.

Mogo Finance Technology Inc.
DigitalX Ltd.
RIOT Blockchain Inc
Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd.

This will include the creation of digital wallets where users can securely buy, sell and accept Bitcoin and other currencies, providing liquidity to worldwide Bitcoin and digital currency exchanges. This company also engages in Promotion/ education of the everyday consumers and merchants about the value of accepting Bitcoin and the benefits. with respect to Business to consumer or B2C segment, they stated that they are developing online stores and various platforms whose goods and services will exclusively support the acceptance of Bitcoin. On Research and Development, the firm is developing innovative technologies that will promote the use of digital currency and conduct extensive research in other emerging forms of cryptocurrency.

Ovesrtock.com, this company's stock price was hyped like crazy in 2017, up from about $20 per share to almost 4 times more - ~80 per share. It's the first online store accepting bitcoin as a currency. The CEO Byrne is well-known for his enthusiasm for crypto assets like bitcoin and initial coin offerings. It has a Medici Ventures division and per its 10-K of 2017: "Our Medici business initiatives leverage the security, transparency and immutability of cryptographically protected, distributed ledgers, such as the Blockchain, and are focused on solving important problems, including financial transaction issues, particularly in the area of securities settlement.

Through diversification into horizontal markets, SinglePoint is building its portfolio by acquiring an interest in undervalued subsidiaries, thereby providing a rich, diversified holding base. Through its subsidiary company SingleSeed, the company is providing products and services to the cannabis industry.  According to the new presss on Nov. 15, 2017, SinglePoint, Inc. (OTC:SING) had a soft launch of a bitcoin exchange aimed at solving payment issues plaguing the cannabis industry.

Mogo Finance Technology Inc. (TSX:MOGO) is a financial technology company focused on building the best digital financial services platform in Canada. From being just a consumer lender, Mogo Finance Technology has evolved into a diversified business platform offering credit score monitoring, cards, mortgages and the soon-to-be-launched cryptocurrencies. Strong quarterly results along with the user base crossing the half-a-million mark highlight this transition and bodes well for the Company to position itself to capture an increasing share of the shift to digital financial services in Canada.

DigitalX Ltd. engages in the development and provision of software applications. It operates through the Trading and Software Development segments. It offers its products under the AirPocket and DigitalX Direct trademarks. With $4 million in funding and solid streams of revenue under its belt, DCC is in an excellent financial position to plunge itself full-throttle into a hectic 2018, as it continues to expand its advisory divisions and seeks to clinch more strategic alliances with major industry players. only listed cryptocurrency company in Australia.

RIOT Blockchain Inc provides investment services to the blockchain ecosystem as well as manufacturing in-vitro substances. Riot Blockchain is emblematic of the on-going bubble in all things cryptocurrencies. As recently as October, Riot was a struggling biotech company that had operated under several names (most recently, Bioptix). Its SEC filings reveal a lengthy list of past business failures, departed executives and board members, and multiple auditors. Having largely failed in the medical business, Bioptix announced in an October 4 press release that it would change its name to Riot Blockchain, becoming a "strategic investor and operator in the blockchain ecosystem with a particular focus on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains," according to its press release.Riot invested in a number of companies that appear to be at least nominally involved in cryptocurrency businesses. In one example, Riot Blockchain made a $3 million minority investment in Coinsquare Ltd, which it called "one of Canada's leading exchanges for trading digital currencies." A chart in an October presentation reveals that Coinsquare had only recently begun to add more than 200 new verified users on a daily basis.

Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. is a growth-oriented building a bridge from the blockchain sector to traditional capital markets. It engages in the production of mined cryptocurrency like Ethereum around the clock. The company was founded on June 24, 1987 and is headquartered in Vancouver, Canada

BTCS, Inc. is a publicly traded company based in the US, whose stated line of business is the development of applications related to blockchain databases and digital currencies.

Skimming through above companies, I notice at least three are based in Vancouver Canada, and two are converted from other failed business. Interesting."

Now what's intersting is to look at them two years later. It's a very good sign if the initial feverish favorite is still favored by the market. Apparently they are all extremely volatile without a good ending, using First Bitcoin Capital Corp. (BITCF-US) as an example, see ![its performance in the past years](https://github.com/znaixian/Research/blob/master/Industry/media/bITCS%20bitcoin%20concept.png)

This reinforced my long-term skepiticism on Bitcoin investment.
