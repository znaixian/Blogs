The original thread from MSCI is here: https://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/hedging-inflation-a-scorecard/02053988929, authored by Juan and Andy.

As is stated in their article, it's an unversal concern that aggressive policy by the Fed and deficit pushed new higher due to Pandemic will lead to an unprecedented inflation in long run. People don't know when and how. Or maybe it will never come. However for those extremely risk-averse investors, finding a solution to hedge inflation is monumentally important. 
So these MSCI researchers take actions to address this need by creating a hedging stratgy: "By taking a long position in TIPS and shorting Treasury futures, investors can create, in effect, an asset that rises in value with inflation". Conduting this strategy retroactively, "analysis shows that this inflation asset generally underperformed other asset classes over the past 13 years".

The detailes are outlined as in below table:

So in sum, they asked this core question "Was it worthy?". Apparently their research indicates such hedging incurred loss instead of protection, however their conclusion plays safe "The benefit from inflation protection, however, has been realized in periods of unexpectedly high inflation, and our historical results were consistent with the view that investors are willing to pay a premium for inflation protection. The experience of the 1970s and early 1980s looms large, serving as a reminder of the damage inflation can inflict on portfolios."

What the reader actually should think deeper is: 1. why their inflation asset is losing money, is it not due to the hedging strategy but the wrong underlying products - TIPS? 2. in coming years, will severe inflation actully happen?
