# China Bond ETFs

In 2020, low interest rate is a global environmnent thanks to the damage caused by COVID pandemic, each country is competing financial easing plan with lowering interest rate as their very first and significant weapon. Germany, Japan etc. are even pushing the rate to the negative bound, as a result, other countries such as the US. are moving toward this direction, like it or not. 

Speculators are betting on this trend by buying in bonds - paradoxical in the sense of interest rate/coupon rate return but the price return is set to rise steep high according to the pricing formula of bonds:

That being said, it's a speculation! investors seeking secure and stable income will be more desperate to find good bonds to invest. A low or even negative interest rate environment pushes bond yield lower too. 

With this macro-level understanding in mind, I think a few countries that remain to keep a positive interest rate is attractive to such investors. Bond ETFs should be a good vehicle. Using ETF.com screener tool, I found so far (Oct 20202) there are only three China Bond ETFs available.
